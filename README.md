hey :)

# TODO 
- fix routes :( use pinia to set project name and retrieve data
- try removing duplicated code with smaller components and inputs
    (ex: double loop in projects && [project] + [mobile] )
- check todo in selectBrackets.vue (+ rename that shitty thing)

- add pretty page transitions (RN it's a bit hard on the eyes and too 'heavy')
- make 404 noice :)
